<p>This is the Github page for my Data Mining course project. Here I explore the possibility of generating decision trees through a sorted list of attributes. This project approached the questions of how to compare the predictive power of attributes and how to sort them.</p>

<p>Quicksort was a bad idea. It was relatively fast and good for implementing, but because Quicksort doesn't swap the exact items it compares, it would often decrease the accuracy of the resulting trees. An in-place sort with direct comparisons probably would have worked better.</p>

<p>I simply did not have the time to give this idea the attention it deserved - it's simply bigger than a single class project can fit. Perhaps the most important part of the final project is the section at the end, listing all the work this idea should have had, but didn't. There's so much to do that I personally may never get around to. It would be nice if someday I learned someone else picked this up and expanded on it. I suppose Github is a good place for that to perhaps happen.</p>
